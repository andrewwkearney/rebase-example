# Git rebase
This is useful information to help with rebasing when your email changes

It's most helpful if your changes haven't been pushed to the remote git system. 
If they have, speak to a friendly dev who can help.

## Find first good commit
To find the commit immediately prior to the non-pushed commit, you need to check
the git log.
